# Automatic Demographic Data Extraction Examples

## üéØ **Overview**

The AI Clinic Assistant now automatically extracts **comprehensive demographic information** from consultation conversations and populates patient records in real-time. No manual data entry required!

## üó£Ô∏è **Example Consultation with Rich Demographic Data**

### **Sample Conversation:**

```
Doctor: "Good morning! Please tell me a bit about yourself before we discuss your symptoms."

Patient: "Hi Doctor. I'm Sarah Johnson, I'm 42 years old. I work as a software engineer at Microsoft. I've been married for 15 years and have two teenage kids."

Doctor: "Thank you. And what brings you in today?"

Patient: "I've been having persistent headaches for the past month. I'm originally from Boston, but we moved to Seattle about 10 years ago for my job."

Doctor: "I see. Do you have any allergies or take any medications?"

Patient: "I'm allergic to shellfish - it gives me hives. I take birth control pills and occasionally ibuprofen for the headaches."

Doctor: "Do you smoke or drink alcohol?"

Patient: "I quit smoking about 5 years ago, thankfully. I used to smoke for about 10 years. I have an occasional glass of wine on weekends."

Doctor: "What's your educational background?"

Patient: "I have a Master's degree in Computer Science from MIT. After that, I worked in Boston for a few years before moving here."

Doctor: "And your current address for our records?"

Patient: "We live at 1234 Pine Street, Seattle, Washington 98101. My husband works at Amazon, so we're both in tech."

Doctor: "Based on your symptoms and the fact that you're a former smoker, I want to run some tests to rule out any serious causes for these headaches..."

## üéõÔ∏è **Smart Data Handling**

### **Non-Overwriting Logic:**

- ‚úÖ **Preserves existing data** - doesn't overwrite manually entered information
- ‚úÖ **Enhances partial data** - improves basic addresses with detailed ones
- ‚úÖ **Validates extracted data** - ensures age calculations and format consistency

### **Examples of Smart Updates:**

| occupation: `"Teacher"` | "I'm a teacher"             | occupation: `"Teacher"` (no change)               |
| address: `"Seattle"`    | "1234 Main St, Seattle, WA" | address: `"1234 Main St, Seattle, WA"` (enhanced) |
| smoking: `null`         | "I don't smoke"             | smoking: `false`                                  |
| smoking: `false`        | "I don't smoke"             | smoking: `false` (no change)                      |
